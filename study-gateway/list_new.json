Judah writes as a friend, welcoming to the discussion new believers, lifelong followers of Jesus, and even the merely curious.\n\nIn Life Is _____, Judah shows us the irrational love of God and the life that he intends for us to have in the here and now. With excitement and humor, he looks at the stories in the Bible from a different angle and shows how life is all about loving God and loving others.",

They did for those who could not give anything in return. Is that how people in your communities would describe you? This study is a tool that will force conversation and reflection around the topic of what to do with what we have. Jesus could not have been any clearer. It\u2019s not what you have that matters. It\u2019s what you do with it that will count for you or against you in the kingdom of heaven.",

Teens will study stories from the young lives of Miriam, Joseph, David, Solomon, Daniel, and Mary to find out why and how they said yes to God's call on their lives. Teens will discover that God can use their lives to do something that matters.",

Each chapter raises the objection using a conversational approach, provides the biblical answers to that objection, gives examples of how churches are addressing the issue, and concludes with follow-through suggestions, discussion questions, and resource listings.",

When these emotions well up inside, it\u2019s difficult to believe we will make it through. We have an enemy who says we will not survive this one. But God offers us a way through the storm. In The Storm Inside, an eight-session, video-based study by Sheila Walsh, you\u2019ll look at the stories of eight women of the Bible who traveled the path from shame to love, from disappointment to hope, from insecurity to confidence, from despair to faith, and more. You will get to know them as real people and see how God came through for each of them. You\u2019ll see the crucial choices they made, and you\u2019ll lay hold of the grace that forgives what is past, gives strength for the present moment, and offers hope for the future.",

In this six-session, video-based study, author and speaker Gari Meacham identifies the path we share as we struggle to engage God in prayer and belief. Gari writes, \u201cWith the authenticity of my own life stories\u2014marriage to a professional baseball player, struggles with severe food bondage, and a father who was a quadriplegic\u2014I came to the crisp realization that my prayer life and the belief needed to match.\" Spirit Hunger provides a clear path toward matching these heart cries\u2014leading away from crumbs and counterfeit, to a hungering for God. Relatable and relative, Gari teaches, out of her own experience, how to stop hiding from God and enter into a soul quenching relationship with Him.",

As she searched for answers to her heart\u2019s yearning and emptiness, Abraham walked out of the pages of her Bible and into her life. Abraham\u2019s life was full of twists and turns, riches and losses, deceit and redemption, failure and success. Nevertheless, his story teaches the key to satisfying a longing heart: embracing a God-filled life. The Magnificent Obsession is a seven-session, video-based study that teaches you and your group to embrace a God-filled life. Choice by Choice. Day by Day. Despite the struggles, learn to know God as Abraham did\u2026 as His friend.",

It starts with God\u2019s design for love and marriage and then works backwards through sex, romance, and singleness. In Loveology, a five-session, video-based study, Pastor and writer John Mark Comer talks about what is right in male/female relationships\u2014what God intended in the Garden. And also what is wrong\u2014the fallout in a post-Eden world. In these five sessions, Comer reveals what the Scriptures have to say about sexuality and relationships and offers intelligent, grace-and-truth answers to your difficult questions about love.",

After enduring generations of slavery in Egypt, the descendants of Jacob travel through the desert toward their new home in Canaan. They crave the food of their former home in Egypt and despise their present environment. They are unable to go back and incapable of moving forward. The Land Between explores the way in which their reactions can provide insight and guidance on how to respond to God during our own seasons of difficult transition. God desires to meet us in our chaos and emotional upheaval to encounter his goodness and provision.",

But if we are all honest, it feels like trying to catch the wind.\nA man after God\u2019s own heart\u2026 As David\u2019s life weaves throughout the pages of Scripture, we see he was a man who spent his life chasing after God. Chase explores the events that defined David\u2019s life and the Psalms that flowed out of those experiences. Through David\u2019s example we\u2019ll discover what God really wants from us.\nThe lessons in this study are simple yet deep and very interactive, offering Bible study, stories, and projects to dig into Scripture and deeply engage the mind and heart. God has carved out a space in each of us that only He can fill. So whether you are running from God or working your tail off to please Him, David\u2019s journey will challenge your view of God.\nGod is invisible, and yet He is the only thing we can chase that won\u2019t leave us feeling more empty.",

You\u2019ll learn about the historical development of the concept of freedom and see how it grows out of the Judeo-Christian worldview. Secular elites have long dictated the terms of Western history\u2014the Dark Ages, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason. Along the way, they have convinced many that the West is free and prosperous in spite of our Christian heritage. The Heritage of Freedom video series provides you with an invaluable tool for countering this revision of history and better grounding your faith in the biblical vision of freedom.",

Billions of people are poor, millions go hungry or thirsty every day. Disease claims thousands of lives daily. But you and I have been given an opportunity to make a big difference. What if we did? What if we rocked the world with hope? Infiltrated all corners with God\u2019s love and life? We are created by a great God to do great works. He invites us to outlive our lives, not just in heaven, but here on earth. What if you lived in such a way that your death is just the beginning of your life? Max Lucado presents four video sessions that follow the real-life stories of people who are making their lives count. In four video sessions designed for individual study or for a small group experience, Max will show you not just why but how to live intentionally so that everything in your life---your time, your skills, your passions---all add up to something bigger than you.",

It doesn\u2019t cost anything, but it demands everything. It demands that we go \u201call in,\u201d a term that simply means placing all that you have into God\u2019s hands. But we\u2019re afraid that if we go all in that we might miss out on what this life has to offer. It\u2019s not true. The only thing you\u2019ll miss out on is everything God has to offer. In All In, a four session, video-based study, Mark Batterson\u2019s teaching is filled with vivid, contemporary stories as well as biblical characters like Shamgar and Elisha and Jonathan and . . . Judas. The message of All In is simple: if Jesus is not Lord of all then Jesus is not Lord at all. It\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s now or never. Kneeling at the foot of the cross of Christ and surrendering to His Lordship is a radical act of dethroning yourself and enthroning Christ as King.",

This is not a group study about \u201cfixing\u201d gay people. It\u2019s about getting to know them, engaging them, and loving them like Jesus does.

This means playing only the role you are intended to play\u2014walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when the Spirit says to talk, and falling silent when the Spirit suggests that you\u2019ve already said enough. More than two thousand years ago, Jesus himself introduced the perfect model for evangelism. He left the marvelous adoration of the angels and the perfection of heaven, and he chose to \u201cwalk\u201d clear across the cosmos. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry, Hybels shows with undeniable clarity the power of this approach to evangelism. The stakes are high. The implications are eternal. And you may be only a conversation away from having unparalleled impact on someone\u2019s life\u2014if you will just walk across the room.",
