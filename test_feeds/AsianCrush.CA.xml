        <description language="en" length="500">An apocalyptic tale that is a return to the trippy, socially-engaged, blackly comic, ridiculously violent revolutionary movies of Japan's 60's. A high school student has a vision that the world is ending and so, faced with no consequences, he abducts a fellow student and goes on a crime spree. Based on Naoki Yamamoto's cult manga, Eiji Uchida's Last Days of the World is a teenage nihilist's pop-psychological mixtape spilled onto celluloid in the dirtiest, dreamiest way possible.</description>

Unfortunately, his idea of lying low involves losing his temper and beating the crap out of a gangster, sparking a conflict of escalating violence and bloodshed.

        <description language="en" length="500">One of the top horror titles to come out of Thailand in recent memory, "Slice" plays out like a twisted mix of "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en." A gruesome serial killer is on the loose, preying on the rich and influential, exposing their sexual proclivities, dismembering them and randomly dumping their severed body parts. With the son of a prominent politician in danger, the law turns to notorious ex-hitman Tai in hopes that fighting fire with fire can stop the killer from slicing again.</description>
